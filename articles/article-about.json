They just happens. However, since I don't remember anything, I won't know any connection between them, I won't even know the current change is happening after another. They are just a set of random phenomena, instead of a constant stream which can help me to understand the term \"time\". To conclude, memory is one of the necessary preconditions of the recognition of the constant stream of changes, thus also necessary for understanding time.",
        "zh": "如果有了变化，我又能观察到这些变化，这就意味着我能理解什么是时间了吗？也不尽然。因为我必须要认知到一连串的连续的变化，才有可能理解时间的概念。如果我都不记得发生过什么，那么所有的事情对我来说就都是全新的、相互独立分离的。我只是会觉得世界上一直都有事情在发生而已。可是，由于我没法记住任何事情，我也不可能理解到事情之间的联系，我甚至都不知道当下我正在观察的变化发生在另外一个变化之后。所有的变化都是一组随机的现象，而不会形成一个持续的变化流，而只有变化形成了一连串的变化流之后才能让我理解时间的含义。所以总结下来，记忆是形成对这种变化流的认知的必要因素，所以同时也就成了理解时间的必要因素了。"

This, is my little theory about time.",

In talking I tend to make a lot mistakes, say something that is not what I meant to say. However if everything is written down, then I can always review and modify it before I publish or send it. It is much more efficent and accurate than keeping explaining myself in a flow.",
