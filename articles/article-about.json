It might be the ticks from a clock on the wall, or the oscillation of a quartz crystal, or even the radiation generated by the electron transition of the caesium 133 atom. But these are all mechanic, these are all artificially invented or defined for meassurement of the time. However, we all know the concept of time even before there is any clock on the wall. So the question is rather, what is _time to me_?",
        "zh": "不过这个**时间**究竟是个什么东西呢？时间可以是墙上的时钟发出的滴答声，或者是石英晶体的振动，甚至可以是铯133原子的电子跃迁产生的辐射。不过这些也太机械了，它们无非都是人类创造或者定义出来的，用来计时的技术罢了。而我们根本不需要什么挂钟就可以体会到时间的存在。所以这个问题更好的问法恐怕应该是“**时间对我来说**是什么”。"

In this case, I still won't understand what is time. It seems that observation is just another key of understanding time.",

Because I have to recognize a chain of changes to be able to get the concept of time. If I don't remember what has happened, everything for me is just completely new and separated and independent. They just happens. Since I don't remember anything, I won't know any connection between them, I won't even know the current change is happening after another. They are just a set of random phenomena, instead of a constant stream which can help me to understand the term \"time\". And memory, just like what have been discussed before, is one of the necessary building blocks of the recognition of the constant stream of changes, thus also necessary for understanding time.",
        "zh": "如果有了变化，我又能观察到这些变化，这就意味着我能理解什么是时间了吗？也不尽然。因为我必须要认知到一连串的变化，才有可能理解时间的概念。如果我都不记得发生过什么，那么所有的事情对我来说就都是新的、相互独立分离的。我会觉得世界上一直都有事情在发生而已。因为我没法记住任何事情，我也不可能理解到事情之间的联系，我甚至都不知道当下我正在观察的变化发生在另外一个变化之后。所有的变化都是一组随机的现象，而不会形成一个持续的变化流，而只有变化形成了一连串的变化流之后才能让我理解时间的含义。至于记忆嘛，如前所述，它是形成对这种变化流的认知的必要因素，同时也就成了理解时间的必要因素了。"
