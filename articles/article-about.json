They just happens. Since I don't remember anything, I won't know any connection between them, I won't even know the current change is happening after another. They are just a set of random phenomena, instead of a constant stream which can help me to understand the term \"time\".

In talking I tend to make a lot mistakes, say something that is not what I meant to say. However if everything is written down, then I can always review and modify it before I publish or send it. It is much more efficent and accurate than keeping explaining myself in a flow.",

As a result, I've found a lot of beautiful details in my life, which will never be noticed without photography. The same effect is also coming from writting a blog. It motivates me to do more meaningful stuff, instead of always falling into the daily routine. Recording and living, they are catalyzing each other.",
